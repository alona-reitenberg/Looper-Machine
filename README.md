## Description
In this project I create a looper machine with audio file using ReactJS.
The looper machine is using different audio files that are played and each one of them can be muted.

I used a different components for each model I’ve create, so the application will be organize and easy to manage. 
The App component is contain a player that is responsible for the sound list and player controller buttons - play, pause, stop and loop.
Inside the sound list I’ve create 9 rows using sound component that displays the sound name, mute\unmute button and progress bar.

There is a slider showing the current position of the audio that is synchronized with the time displayed on the control player.
All of the components are connected tougher so the application will function correctly.
